    <h1>Welcome! 欢迎!</h1>
    <h2>To save your time, here is a quick intro of myself.</h2>
    <p>
        Yutian Pang is a mechanical engineering Ph.D. at Arizona State University, expected to graduate at the end of
        2022. He's received his bachelor's degree of mechanical engineering from Huazhong University of Science and
        Technology in 2017. He is
        currently working on the big data project namely big data information fusion for next-generation air traffic
        management system, which focuses on building machine learning models to address real-world safety concerns in
        the aviation field. Yutian Pang has hands-on experience with dealing with massive (geospatial) datasets using
        Pandas(GeoPandas), Spark(GeoSpark), and databases such as PostgreSQL. He has also finished several topics such
        as spatial-temporal graph transformer networks for multi-aircraft collaborative trajectory prediction and
        separation risk assessment in the near-terminal airspace, uncertainty quantification of trajectory prediction
        using Bayesian Deep Learning, Bayesian neural network robustness study in safety-critical domains for image
        classification tasks, variational autoencoder for traffic density prediction, etc. He is proficient with both
        Tensorflow and Torch with CUDA. The detailed code examples
        can be found from my GitHub. He's also a computer enthusiastic interested in dealing
        with <b>computer softwares</b> (variants of Linux OS, CUDA, Docker) as well as <b>hardwares</b> (GPU servers,
        HPCs).
        Yutian Pang is a
        <b>self-motivated researcher/learner</b> and he is always excited about exploring new things/new technologies,
        and
        bring it
        into real-world products. I also enjoy driving and roadtrips.
